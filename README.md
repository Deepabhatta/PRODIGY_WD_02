# PRODIGY_WD_02 - Stopwatch Web Application ⏱️

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a clean and functional **Stopwatch Web Application** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** as part of my internship task at **PRODIGY INFOTECH**.  
It allows users to start, pause, reset the timer, and record multiple lap times in an intuitive, responsive interface.

## 🚀 Features
- Start, Pause, and Reset functionality
- Accurate time display in **HH:MM:SS.MS** format
- Unlimited lap recording with a scrollable list
- Smooth transitions and hover effects for buttons
- Fully responsive and modern UI

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — page structure  
- **CSS3** — custom styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** — core stopwatch logic, event handling, DOM manipulation
